        "## Scientific Objective\n\nThis use case calls multiple tools to produce diagnostic plots of systematic erros relative to a\nfeature (e.g. hurricane, MCS, etc...). This use case calls a user provided python script that\ncalculates a diagnostic of interest (e.g. integrated vapor transport, potential vorticity, etc...).\nThis user diagnostic is then used to define the systematic errors. This example calculates statistics\nover varying forecast leads with the ability to define lead groupings. This use case is very similar\nto the Multi_Tools: Feature Relative by Lead use case.\n(ADeck,GFS:BDeck,GFS:ATCF,Grib2)\n\nBy maintaining focus of each evaluation time (or evaluation time series, in this case)\non a user-defined area around a cyclone, the model statistical errors associated\nwith cyclonic physical features (moisture flux, stability, strength of upper-level\nPV anomaly and jet, etc.) can be related directly to the model forecasts and provide\nimprovement guidance by accurately depicting interactions with significant weather\nfeatures around and within the cyclone. This is in contrast to the traditional\nmethod of regional averaging cyclone observations in a fixed grid, which\n\"smooths out\" system features and limits the meaningful metrics that can be gathered.\nSpecifically, this use case creates bins of forecast lead times as specified by the\ngiven ranges which provides additional insight directly into forecast lead time accuracy.\n\nAdditionally, the ability to calculate model statistical errors based on user provided diagnostics\nallows the user to customize the feature relative analysis to suit their needs.\n\n"

        "## METplus Components\n\nThis use case first runs PyEmbedIngest to run the user provided python scripts to calculate the\ndesired diagnostic (in this example, IVT). PyEmbedIngest runs the RegridDataPlane tool to write \nIVT to a MET readable netCDF file. Then TCPairs and ExtractTiles are run to generate matched\ntropical cyclone data and regrid them into appropriately-sized tiles along a storm track. \nThe MET tc-stat tool is used to filter the track data and the MET regrid-dataplane tool is used to \nregrid the data (GRIB1 or GRIB2 into netCDF). Next, a series analysis by lead time is performed on \nthe results and plots (.ps and .png) are generated for all variable-level-stat combinations from \nthe specified variables, levels, and requested statistics. If lead grouping is turned on, the final\nresults are aggregated into forecast hour groupings as specified by the start, end and increment in\nthe METplus configuration file, as well as labels to identify each forecast hour grouping.
