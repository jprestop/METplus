        "## Scientific Objective\n\nBy maintaining focus of each evaluation time (or evaluation time series, in this case)\non a user-defined area around a cyclone, the model statistical errors associated\nwith cyclonic physical features (moisture flux, stability, strength of upper-level\nPV anomaly and jet, etc.) can be related directly to the model forecasts and provide\nimprovement guidance by accurately depicting interactions with significant weather\nfeatures around and within the cyclone. This is in contrast to the traditional\nmethod of regional averaging cyclone observations in a fixed grid, which\n\"smooths out\" system features and limits the meaningful metrics that can be gathered.\nSpecifically, this use case creates bins of forecast lead times as specified by the\ngiven ranges which provides additional insight directly into forecast lead time accuracy.\n\n"

The MET tc-stat tool is used to filter the\ntrack data, and the MET regrid-dataplane tool is used to regrid the\ndata (GRIB1 or GRIB2 into netCDF). Next, a series analysis by lead time is\nperformed on the results and plots (.ps and .png) are generated for all\nvariable-level-stat combinations from the specified variables, levels, and\nrequested statistics.

        "## Running METplus\n\nThis use case can be run two ways:\n\n1) Passing in TCStat_SeriesAnalysis_fcstGFS_obsGFS_FeatureRelative_SeriesByLead.conf, then a user-specific system configuration file::\n\n       master_metplus.py -c /path/to/METplus/parm/use_cases/model_applications/medium_range/TCStat_SeriesAnalysis_fcstGFS_obsGFS_FeatureRelative_SeriesByLead.conf\n       -c /path/to/user_system.conf\n\n2) Modifying the configurations in parm/metplus_config, then passing in TCStat_SeriesAnalysis_fcstGFS_obsGFS_FeatureRelative_SeriesByLead.conf::\n\n       master_metplus.py -c /path/to/METplus/parm/use_cases/model_applications/medium_range/TCStat_SeriesAnalysis_fcstGFS_obsGFS_FeatureRelative_SeriesByLead.conf\n\nThe former method is recommended. Whether you add them to a user-specific configuration file or modify the metplus_config files, the following variables must be set correctly:\n\n* **INPUT_BASE** - Path to directory where sample data tarballs are unpacked (See Datasets section to obtain tarballs). This is not required to run METplus, but it is required to run the examples in parm/use_cases\n* **OUTPUT_BASE** - Path where METplus output will be written. This must be in a location where you have write permissions\n* **MET_INSTALL_DIR** - Path to location where MET is installed locally\n\n and for the [exe] section, you will need to define the location of\n NON-MET executables.  If the executable is in the user's path, METplus will find it from\n the name. If the executable is not in the path, specify the full\n path to the executable here (i.e. RM = /bin/rm)  The following executables are required\n for performing series analysis use cases:\n\n If the executables are in the path:\n\n* **RM = rm**\n* **CUT = cut**\n* **TR = tr**\n* **NCAP2 = ncap2**\n* **CONVERT = convert**\n* **NCDUMP = ncdump**\n\n**NOTE:** All of these executable items must be located under the [exe] section.\n\n\nIf the executables are not in the path, they need to be defined:\n\n* **RM = /path/to/rm**\n* **CUT = /path/to/cut**\n* **TR = /path/to/tr**\n* **NCAP2 = /path/to/ncap2**\n* **CONVERT = /path/to/convert**\n* **NCDUMP= /path/to/ncdump**\n\n**NOTE:** All of these executable items must be located under the [exe] section.\nExample User Configuration File::\n\n  [dir]\n  INPUT_BASE = /path/to/sample/input/data\n  OUTPUT_BASE = /path/to/output/dir\n  MET_INSTALL_DIR = /path/to/met-X.Y\n\n  [exe]\n  RM = /path/to/rm\n  CUT = /path/to/cut\n  TR = /path/to/tr\n  NCAP2 = /path/to/ncap2\n  CONVERT = /path/to/convert\n  NCDUMP = /path/to/ncdump\n\n**NOTE:** The INPUT_BASE, OUTPUT_BASE, and MET_INSTALL_DIR must be located under the [dir] section, while the RM, CUT, TR, NCAP2, CONVERT, and NCDUMP must be located under the [exe] section.\n\n"
